I made this blog because I wanted to talk about my experiences being a non-technical person who fell down the the Linux/open source rabbit hole and started contributing to an open source project.

I'd used FOSS software for a while and, as cheesy as it sounds, I wanted to give something back to the community that provides me with all these wonderful apps for free. Unfortunately I didn't have money or know how to code. Then I found out that software projects need people who write user guides, and help pages, and other stuff that humanities majors can help with.

It's been a bit of a wild ride, a hell of a learning curve, and most of the time I feel like I have no idea what I'm doing, hence the title. 

Most of the people I meet are from some kind of software background, so I thought there might be some value in me talking about my experiences in case there  are other people out there who didn't know this is a thing you can do.

Full disclosure, I do have a Graduate Certificate in Information Technology, but it had more of a focus on business process management than software development. I'm not someone with "hard" technical skills and I've mostly worked administration (not the computer kind) and document production.
