I'm a Linux noob with no background in software development who somehow got involved in writing help pages for a FOSS project. Thes are my stories.

I was going to wait until I got this site looking all nice any pretty before I started posting. Then it occurred to me that the janky theme and broken css fit with the general vibe. So enjoy.

This site was built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme, but please don't blame them for how my site looks. It worked fine before I tried to "customize" it.
